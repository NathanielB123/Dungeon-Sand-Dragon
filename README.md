# Dungeon-Sand-Dragon

A party-based RPG that I, AdamBomb-3141, Cjo3141592 and jelven261 made.
Made for a week-long school competition thing to make a game in python in a week based on 3 random words, ours being desert, fountain and jigsaw.

Credits:
Most of the code - Nathaniel Burke (me)
Art and stat/level up code - Josh Bryce (Cjo3141592)
Ability code - Jacob Elven (jelven261)
Music and making an effort to clean up my attrocious code- AdamBomb-3141
