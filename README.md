# Dungeon-Sand-Dragon

A party-based RPG that I, AdamBomb-3141, Cjo3141592 and jelven261 made.
Made for a week-long school competition thing to make a game in python in a week based on 3 random words, ours being desert, fountain and jigsaw.

Installation:

Simply download, extract and run Dungeon Sand Dragon Compiled.exe to play the game

Notes on launching the game:

The game takes a while to launch - please wait around 10 seconds and don't click on the text window that first comes up.
The game will crash instantly if there is no available audio device; make sure you have speakers or headphones enabled and working if the game crashes.
The game may crash or look weird on resolutions other than 1920 by 1080.
