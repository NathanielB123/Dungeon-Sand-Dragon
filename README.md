# Dungeon-Sand-Dragon

A party-based RPG that I, AdamBomb-3141, Cjo3141592 and jelven261 are making.
Made for a week-long school competition thing to make a game in python in a week based on 3 random words, ours being desert, fountain and jigsaw.

This is still a work in progress so expect tons of unfinished features, bugs and missing mechanics.
